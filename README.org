* Introduction

  This is just my Emacs configuration. It auto-installs all packages
  using mostly elpa and some from el-get.

  For a glance of all installed packages check all `user-package'
  declarations.

* Requirements

These are the necessary packages for all enabled plugins.

  + Emacs 24.x
  + Bazaar: for package downloads.
  + CVS: for package downloads.
  + Git: for package downloads and magit.
  + Mercurial: for package downloads.
  + SVN: for package downloads.
  + leiningen 2.x: for nrepl and friends.
  + python (2.6 or 2.7): for building jedi.

See "Disabling packages" section for a way to avoid some requirements.

** Arch GNU/Linux
Installation of all requirements in Arch is quite simple.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pacman -S bzr cvs git mercurial subversion emacs python2
#+END_SRC

** Ubuntu

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install bzr cvs git mercurial subversion emacs python
#+END_SRC

* Installation

When you meet all requirements, everything should install
automatically after you launch Emacs. If some package fail because
of a network connection failure or anything, restarting Emacs will
continue installation from that point.

There are 3 non-required important files you might want to check out:
  + ~/.emacs.d/secrets.el: This is a file I'm using to store my IRC
    password and other sensible stuff.
  + ~/.emacs.d/pre-startup.el: This file might contain any lisp
    that's intended to be run *before* all packages are loaded and
    initialized.
  + ~/.emacs.d/post-startup.el: This file might contain any lisp
    that's intended to be run *after* all packages are loaded and
    initialized.

If you are using jedi, you need to install a python environment for it
to use. You can do so like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa/jedi-*
make requirements PYTHON=python2  # or the python interpreter of your preference.
#+END_SRC

If you plan to use the clojure related packages you need to install
leiningen. Generally you want to do this manually by adding the
executable in your =$PATH=. See http://leiningen.org/ for
instructions.

* Disabling packages

If you don't want to install some packages you can use
the *pre-startup.el* file to modify the =my:disabled-packages=
variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; pre-startup.el
;; Avoid installing/loading some packages.
(setq my:disabled-packages '(ace-jump-mode jedi clojure-mode))
#+END_SRC

If you plan byte-compiling the init file (which is recommended) via
the =byte-compile-file= or =emacs-lisp-byte-compile= command (i.e. not
in batch mode), be sure to eval =my:disabled-packages= new value and
then eval the whole init.el buffer, so the =user-package= macro is
expanded properly for newly enabled/disabled packages.

* Bug Reports

  If you find a configuration bug please report it in the github
  tracker. Any package bugs must be reported in their upstream bug
  tracker.

* License

  See each package located at =~/.emacs.d/el-get/= and
  =~/.emacs.d/elpa/= for their licenses.  The =~/.emacs.d/init.el=
  file is on the public domain.
