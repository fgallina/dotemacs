* Introduction

  This is just my Emacs configuration. It auto-installs all packages
  using mostly elpa and some from el-get.

  For a glance of all installed packages check all `user-package'
  declarations.

* Requirements

These are the necessary packages for all enabled plugins.

  + Emacs 24.x
  + Bazaar: for package downloads.
  + CVS: for package downloads.
  + Git: for package downloads and magit.
  + Mercurial: for package downloads.
  + SVN: for package downloads.
  + GNU Make: for package builds.
  + GNU texinfo 4.13[0]: for building builds.
  + leiningen 2.x: for nrepl and friends.
  + taglib (development files): For emms-print-metadata build.
  + python (2.6 or 2.7): for building jedi.
  + xapian-core: for building mu (mu4e).
  + libtool: for building mu (mu4e).
  + gmime: for building mu (mu4e).
  + sqlite3: for building mu (mu4e).
  + gtk2: for building mu (mu4e).
  + webkitgtk2: for building mu (mu4e).

See "Disabling packages" section for a way to avoid some requirements.

[0] Version may (or may not) 5.0 break when building some docs, so far
this elpa based config seems to work just fine as I have installed all
packages from scratch using it.

** Arch GNU/Linux
Installation of all requirements in Arch is quite simple.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pacman -S emacs bzr cvs git mercurial subversion\
 make texinfo taglib python2 xapian-core libtool gmime\
 sqlite3 gtk2 webkitgtk2
#+END_SRC

* Installation

When you meet all requirements, everything should install
automatically after you launch Emacs. If some package fail because
of a network connection failure or anything, restarting Emacs will
continue installation from that point.

There are 3 non-required important files you might want to check out:
  + ~/.emacs.d/secrets.el: This is a file I'm using to store my IRC
    password and other sensible stuff.
  + ~/.emacs.d/pre-startup.el: This file might contain any lisp
    that's intended to be run *before* all packages are loaded and
    initialized.
  + ~/.emacs.d/post-startup.el: This file might contain any lisp
    that's intended to be run *after* all packages are loaded and
    initialized.

Also, if you are using jedi, you need to install a python
environment for it to use. You can do so like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa/jedi-*
make requirements PYTHON=python2  # or the python interpreter of your preference.
#+END_SRC

* Disabling packages

If you don't want to install some packages you can use
the *pre-startup.el* file to modify the =my:disabled-packages=
variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; pre-startup.el
;; Avoid installing/loading some packages.
(setq my:disabled-packages '(mu4e o-blog org-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Bug Reports

  If you find a configuration bug please report it in the github
  tracker. Any package bugs must be reported in their upstream bug
  tracker.

* License

  See each package located at ~/.emacs.d/el-get/* for their licenses.
  The ~/.emacs.d/init.el is on the public domain.  All
  ~/.emacs.d/init-*.el and ~/.emacs.d/startup.d/*.el are on the public
  domain unless otherwise stated in the header.
